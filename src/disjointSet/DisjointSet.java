 * http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=tutorials&d2=disjointDataStructure
 * 
 * Two sets are disjoint if their intersection is null
 * 
 * For example set {1, 2, 3} and set {1, 5, 6} arenâ€™t disjoint because they have in common {1}, but the sets
 * {1, 2, 3} and {5, 6} are disjoint because their intersection is null.
 *  
 * In a data structure of disjoint sets every set contains a representative, which is one member of the set.
 *  
 * Based on implementation by Mark Allen Weiss
