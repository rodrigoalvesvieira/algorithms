 * The Convex Hull of a set of N points is the smallest perimeter fence enclosing all the N points
 * 
 * The Convex Hull. Definitions:
 * 
 * 1. The smallest convex set containing all the points in a Graph
 * 2. Smallest area convex polygon enclosing the points
 * 3. Convex polygon enclosing the points, whose vertices are points in set
